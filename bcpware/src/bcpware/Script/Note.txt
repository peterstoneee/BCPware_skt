 - TCP_02_Circulate_Ink.txt
 - TCP_03_Prime_PH_With_Tube_Cleaning_Soultion.txt

////////// Note - 2018/07/24 Tue
* Optimize Step 3 of waste binder removal
 - Waste_Binder_Removal_3_Tube.txt
* Add a new script to minus QA after waste binder removal.
 - Waste_Binder_Removal_4_ConsumeInk.txt

////////// Note - 2018/07/16 Mon
* Modify Waste Binder Removal(Color Mixed Binder) procedure.
 - Waste_Binder_Removal_3_Tube.txt
  - Add additional 200 revs of waste pump to remove additional ink that may exist in the tube.

////////// Note - 2018/05/31 Thu
* Add Midjob_Dynamic.txt
 - From SW side for dynamic midjob
 - Have to note that the script in this file is not the original format(not complete)
* Modify ConsumeInk order
* Modify Midjob to spit before wipe
* Modify Midjob to disable capping during printing

////////// Note - 2018/03/05 Mon
* Modify idle maintenance period.
 - Currently we set the period to 30 mins.
 - Memjet recommend to set the period to 8 hours.
 - Project meeting decides to set the period to 4 hours now.
 - This changes(change idle maintenance period) will be on SW side.

////////// Note - 2018/01/19 Fri
* Modify TCP_04_Remove_PH_Only
 - Change latch open position at spittoon(wipe position).

////////// Note - 2018/01/17 Wed
* Modify the pressure prime RPM from 350 to 330.
 - Waiting feedback from Memjet about this changes.
* Tested on LP3_4.

////////// Note - 2017/12/25 Mon
* Add Tube Cleaning Procedure script
 - TCP_01_Deprime_PH_Not_Remove_PH.txt
 - TCP_02_Circulate_Ink.txt
 - TCP_03_Prime_PH_With_Tube_Cleaning_Soultion.txt
 - TCP_04_Remove_PH_Only.txt

////////// Note - 2017/12/01 Fri
* Update ConsumeInk.
* Update color mixed binder removal
 - Waste_Binder_Removal.txt
  - Split into 3 files.

////////// Note - 2017/11/24 Fri
*Let user to clean capper
 - Remove_PH.txt
   - PH will go to spittoon, then release PH latch.
 - Install PH
   - On SW side
     - Check whether PH is installed
     - Move PH module to spittoon position
       - /maint/activate -> On
       - /ststua/system_setup -> ServiceMode(On)
       - /maint/ss_mod_goto -> ModulePos(wipe)
     - Inform user to check/clean capper
     - User press OK/Continue button
     - Move PH module to cap position <-- don't need this
       - /maint/ss_mod_goto -> ModulePos(cap) <-- don't need this
       - /status/sysyem_setup -> ServiceMode(Off)
       - /maint/activate -> Off
    - Primed_New_PH.txt
      - Add a wipe at the beginning of script, to clean waste ink on PH nozzle plate
*Color mixed binder removal
 - Waste_Binder_Removal.txt
   - To waste pump color mixed binder, also circulate at the same time, which will remove all the color mixed binder.
 - Original_Memjet_Script/delay.txt
   - Initialilze Sirius.
 - Prime_New_PH.txt
   - PH nozzle plate may have waste ink after installation, so add a wipe at the beginning of script.

////////// Note - 2017/11/02 Thu
* For different machine(e.g. LP2_7) may still have ink near PH after deprime.
(Ink level of IR is acceptable, only if all the tube length is controllable)
  -> rollback to its original procedure.
* Capper may have waste ink on it, which may related to color mixed.
  -> Change pressure prime pos to cap.
  -> Additionally add waste pump before pressure prime
  -> Delete a delay after pressure prime
* It'll consume a lot of ink after pressure prime
  -> Reduce the revs to 20
* May have to many waste ink under capper.
  -> Review all the waste ink revs.
  -> Heavy/Prime will pump for 1.5 mins.
* Update ConsumeInk based on new pressure prime revs.
  -> 5020 ul/ch


////////// Note - 2017/09/04
*Consider ink consumed.

////////// Note - 2017/08/31
* Midjob change back to 4 pages

////////// Note - 2017/08/24
*For midjob setting of "location"
Location: NVM
	script & other parameters(page interval) will save in NVM(test page interval only currently)
Location: RAM
	script will save in RAM
	other parameters(page interval) will save in NVM
